# Enhancing-Performance-of-Recommendation-Systems-through-Intelligent-Collaborative-Filtering-Techniqu
This project introduces advanced AI techniques to promote collaborative filtering (CF) performance. Using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), a comprehensive CF framework for almost 60-90 similarity measures will be presented. Considering the data sparsity problem, new similarity measures are developed to promote CF performance. The novelty of these measures is embedded in their simplistic design, efficiency, and capability to overcome the data sparsity by addressing the relationships among the correlated and non-correlated users/items. To achieve highly sustainable performance, word2vector (C-BOW and Skip Gram) is utilized. Furthermore, advanced variations of KNN, support vector machine (SVM), multi nominal Bayesian (MNB), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are evolved, and integrated with the top-performer similarity measures to further improve CF performance. Finally, sentimental analysis is leveraged to boost CF rendering. All proposed techniques are evaluated against the state-of-the-art rivals regarding effectiveness and efficiency on several benchmarked datasets, like MovieLens (100K, 1M),  and Netflix.
